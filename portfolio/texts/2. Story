I think this text was the easiest to write, as I found writing it fun. I wanted to write a children's story. Children's stories usually have a lesson to be learned in them, but I was set on my story not having any lesson at all, and I think I succeeded in that. I didn't plan the text as I invented most of the story while writing it and doing multiple iterations of it.

The first version:

3. A very generic children's story
Some time ago, in a forest not so far away, there existed a lonely ant colony. For a long time, it lived peacefully in a pleasant place between two large old pines. But all of that had changed, when a young boy had moved into a house near the forest.

The people who used to live in that house, were old, pleasant and respectful towards nature. They had visited the colony a few times, but were careful about getting too close and disturbing the ants. They had moved away a while ago, as they were getting too old to live in a house and wanted to move to an apartment. 

The new family that moved there had a son that also enjoyed roaming around in the forest, but he lacked respect towards nature. Every time he went past the colony, he kicked it, immensely enjoying the sight of the ants swarming on the surface of the nest. 

Once upon a rainy day, the boy, once again, went outside. This time he was feeling bitter. His mom wouldn’t buy him the toy he wanted, so he craved revenge. He headed straight for the ant nest, and kicked it as hard as he could. The boy lost his balance and fell, the ants were enraged, they crawled all over his body as he squirmed and tried to get away.

He finally managed to get up, and started running towards home. As he finally reached the door, he was soaking wet and shivering. Worst of all, his skin was covered with ant bites, which itched sorely and caused intense discomfort. Because of the crippling discomfort he started crying uncontrollably, so his mom heard him screaming behind the door and let him in. 

She helped her son get warm and healed his itches and the scratches that he’d gotten when desperately trying to get out of the woods. She even bought him the toy he had been asking for, because she was feeling guilty for causing the boy to storm into the forest. As a result, the boy learned nothing and even to this day, he kicks every ant colony he walks by on his daily walks in the woods.
