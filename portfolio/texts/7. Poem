The summer is already almost over

I don´t think that time could pass any slower

I´m stuck in Philosophy class

This is all the enthusiasm I was able to amass


Luckily the pain ends soon

I´ll be out of here before noon

Then I get to be on vacation

Reading text books about inflation


It´s not much of a vacation is it

I still might pay my summer cottage a visit

Maybe it´s not so bad

After all I´m kind of glad
