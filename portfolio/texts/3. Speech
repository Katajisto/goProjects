This was a hard text to write, as I didn't really feel that any of the possible subjects were familiar. I planned the text a bit, but really most of the texts was invented while writing it. 

Suunnittelu:

Yleisö on joku kansainvälinen bisnesihmisyleisö
	⇒ Virallinen kieli
Nuoria kannattaa palkata eli siis vaikuttaminen
Nuorilla on enemmän energiaa
Asiat paremmin hallussa
Osaavat luonnostaan käyttää laitteita ja ovat siten tehokkaampia
Puheen tyyli on vakava ja argumentoiva. Voi sisältää pienen määrän huumoria

The first version of the text:

4. Why hire young people

Tuomas Katajisto 17B

Ladies and Gentlemen, it is an honor to address you about this very important matter. Many young people have a hard time finding work so they are getting frustrated with their situation and getting isolated from our society. If this progress continues as is, combined with the problem of our aging population, our society will eventually collapse.

Any company that is concerned with its long term success must be aware of this issue and do something about it. If young people get isolated from society, there won’t be any customers for your products. Nor will there be skilled workers for you, as the isolated young people didn’t go to school because their employment prospects looked exceedingly dim.

I didn’t come here just to try to scare you with a frightening potential future scenario. In addition to saving our welfare state, you will also benefit greatly while doing so. Young people have grown up with technology, so they are naturally very efficient at using it in comparison to older employees.

Even though your older employees have been doing their jobs for a long time and have massive amounts of experience, they might be stuck in their ways. Young people have fresh and original viewpoints to doing business.

This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t value experience. Just remember that having a mix of more experienced employees and younger innovators will be tremendously beneficial for you.

Let’s all make sure that our welfare state stays functional and help young people find work so they can make businesses thrive. Thank you.
