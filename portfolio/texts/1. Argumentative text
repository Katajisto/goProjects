This was the first text of the course, so it was probably the hardest to write. I didn't really like the subjects and had to change between them multiple times. I didn't plan the text, as that was my usual style of writing before the course.

1 Why hinder progress

Robots and artificial intelligence will ultimately make humans ineffective at doing any task compared to them. This forces us to make significant changes to our society. I’d argue that until we’re able to automate a significant majority of jobs, we need to limit the usage of automation, or otherwise force companies not to replace most humans with robots. 

This might seem radical, and many would argue that it limits the pace at which we progress towards the fully automated future many dream of. This might be true to some extent, but we need to make sure the transition to a fully automated utopian society goes smoothly, or it just might become a dystopia. 

My stance is best explained by an example. If we look at the transportation industry, we can see that driving trucks employs a large amount of people. If all of these people are replaced by self driving trucks, we lose a huge amount of jobs. This scenario is not far away as self driving cars are improving rapidly.

This means we’d have lot of people that are unemployed. We need to either find new jobs for these people, or the government needs to provide a living for them. Many say, that automation brings as many new jobs as it replaces. In my honest opinion this is just not true. At some point the last jobs remaining will be the ones that design, program and manufacture this automation equipment. There is no way, we can get everyone on planet Earth or even Finland a job doing this.

Until most jobs are automated, we must make sure that most people have jobs. We can do this by for example forcing self driving trucks to still have people inside them overseeing the driving in case of emergencies. After almost every job is automated, the government can start providing people a living and doing something like universal basic income. This needs to be done after almost everything is automated or people will feel like the system is unfair as some people need to work and some people don’t.
