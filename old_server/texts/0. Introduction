A bit about the way I implemented the portfolio. It's a server written in Go, it serves texts from a directory. It was written with focus on speed, even though it probably isn't very important in this case.

The self evaluation written on the first lesson:

1. I chose to participate on the writing course because I know that wiring will be an important part of the matriculation exam.

2. I would like to learn how to write more coherent texts. 
I expect that I will improve a lot because getting detailed feedback and being forced to actually listen to it will probably help.

3. Polishing a text and focusing on it. 

4. Getting detailed feedback on what is wrong with my writing, so I can fix it.

5. I want to most things done during the lessons, but I am prepared to do some work at home.

6. I like writing in English. I feel like I can write more freely in English than in Finnish.
