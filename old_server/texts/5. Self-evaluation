End-of-course self-evaluation

1. I think it was a good choice. I learned more about writing and most importantly got more experience under my belt.

2. Writing ~90p texts consistently.

3. More about the little things about writing, for example, word choice.

4. Fact based texts were easier than the text that needed a bit of personality.

5. I could've focused a bit more on some texts, but I'm fairly pleased with the results. I wouldn't do anything differently.

6. Yes. The feedback on the texts has made several things more clear, and this has made me a better writer.
