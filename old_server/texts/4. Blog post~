So this text was fairly easy to write, but I wrote it in a hurry after my surgery, so the content wasn't really that great. I feel that I should've probably picked the article option as it was hard to make the blog post have enough depth.

Procrastination
After 2 years in high school, I have mastered the art of procrastination. Nowadays it really doesn’t even affect my grades. When I started high school, I studied for exams 3 weeks in advance and studied for every test I had to take. This well organized approach quickly degenerated into an unsystematic last-minute strategy.

The fascinating thing about the latter strategy is that it got me the same results in school. This meant that I gradually started doing less and less work. Since it got me good results, why wouldn’t I continue doing decreasing my workload and see when I would hit the point where I couldn’t do any less work without it affecting my grades. I still haven’t hit that point, even though I basically don’t study for any of my tests more than I am able to study before going to bed on the day before the test.

The benefits of procrastination are clear. You work less, so you have more free time, and as we all know, time equals money. Now, you might question that how on earth do you work less if you procrastinate, if you don’t the workload is just spread evenly on a larger timespan, but in my experience, every time you start doing schoolwork, you have to spend some time getting started. If you do everything in one go, the amount of times you have to get into the flow of writing again is minimized. 

There are also some drawbacks to procrastinating. Even if you get results that seem good, you might not learn the things you were supposed to learn properly because you are skipping most things in order to just learn the most crucial pieces of information. This is why I am thinking about starting to study properly, as I want to do well in the matriculation exams. But we’ll see if I’m able to make the switch.
